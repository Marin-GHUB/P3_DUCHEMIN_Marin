Note that the MongoDB Base used in this project was too large to include. It can be retrieve at : https://world.openfoodfacts.org/

Based on the OpenFoodFact database, we will create a prototype for an app. 
The idea will be to conceive a shop list for a week worth of food. You will have the opportunity to chose the type of list you want depending on wether you want something healthy, environment friendly, cheap, etc.
